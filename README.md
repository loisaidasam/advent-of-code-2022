## Day 7: No Space Left On Device

change directories, sum file sizes, etc.

- traversing trees, parent-child relationships
- classes
- pointers
- stringstream for splitting strings
- recursion

## Day 8: Treetop Tree House

walk around grid looking at tree heights

- 2d arrays
- char to int

## Day 14: Regolith Reservoir

draw a grid with some boundaries, drop sand into it, see how it falls

- classes
- sparse matrices (in theory, i got it to work without actually using one)

Note: I modified the inputs to just be space-separated ints instead of parsing all the nonsense
